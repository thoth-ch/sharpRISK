notes for implementing a risk update tab

# user experience

input the risk number
see the risk fields appear completed with the current info (if the risk exists)
modify the text in any field as desired
click save button when ready

# ideas for implementation

1. add input field to collect risk number (exist already)
2. reactive function to check if input field exists and to trigger population of other fields
3. function to query data base and retrieve the other fields
4. other fields need to be reactive to get input from backend when risk retrieve function runs

5. function to update the risk in the data base in two steps: 
5.1. first delete the current risk data from the data base 
5.2. second insert the new risk in the data base
